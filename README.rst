Wikidata Handy Interface in Python
==================================

Juste some basic wrappers built around mainly wikidataintegrator and pywikibot
to gather some Wikidata info about stuff.

This is not meant to be a big thing, just some convenience tool I used for some
specific purpose. The interface is very lacking but maybe you will find a couple
things that might be useful for your use case. It is very bare bones and just
aims to avoid writing lots of dictionary keys.
